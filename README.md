# Dynamite Programming Language

Dynamite is a new programming language based on C++, designed for creating powerful and efficient applications. This is an ongoing project that currently only supports a very limited set of features.

## Features

- **C++ Syntax**: Leverages familiar C++ syntax and semantics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++20 compatible compiler
- LLVM 19.0+ (bin directory must be in PATH)
- Python3 (optional)

### Building

Build instructions for this project can be found in the [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) file. Supported platforms are Windows (vs2022 & make), Linux (make).

### Writing

Writing custom Dynamite code is currently quite tedious. Checkout an example here [SYNTAX.md](SYNTAX.md).
